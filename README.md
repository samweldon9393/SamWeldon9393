# My Personal Website  

This website acts as my **portfolio** — a place to:  
- Showcase what I’m currently working on (and past projects)  
- Share a little bit about myself  
- Post photos for friends and family

## Projects  

At the moment, there are **four projects** posted here. I’ll be adding more soon!  

### Featured: [Reddit Hates Coaches](https://github.com/samweldon9393/Reddit-Hates-Coaches)  
- Built using **D3.js** to create an **interactive graph**  
- Highlights the relationship between **comment volume** and **sentiment**  
- My favorite piece is the bar graph, which makes the sentiment–volume relationship visually clear
