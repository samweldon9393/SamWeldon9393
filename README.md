<h1> My Personal Website </h1>

<p> This website acts as a portfolio - a place to display what I'm working on
or have worked on, as well tell interested parties a little bit about myself
and share some pictures with friends and family!</p>

<h3>
Projects Section
</h3>
<p> Right now I just have two projects posted here, but as soon as I get the 
time I have a couple of new things to add.</p>
<p> The little poker game was the big project in my Intro to Java class. I 
included it here as translating it into JavaScript was my way to teach myself 
the language. </p>
<p> Reddit Hates Coaches can be found on my GitHub. I used d3 to create an 
interactive graph. I like the bar graph because it illustrates the relationship
between comment volume and sentiment. </p>
